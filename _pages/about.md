Mia is a PhD student in her last year at University of Kassel in Germany. Since her bachelor’s, she has been interested in high-performance computing (HPC). Her research interests include fault tolerance and load balancing for task-based parallel programs on supercomputers. 

She's passionate about solving the challenges that come with pushing HPC to its limits.
Specializing in Asynchronous Many-Task Programming, she focuses on building fault-tolerant and load-balanced systems that scale effortlessly as core counts keep growing.
With more cores come more failures—her mission is to ensure that supercomputers can thrive under pressure, delivering peak performance even when things go wrong.
From resilience to efficiency, she helps keep the world's most powerful machines running at their best.
