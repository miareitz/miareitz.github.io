I am a PhD student in my last year at University of Kassel in Germany. Since my bachelor's, I have been interested in high-performance computing (HPC).
My passions are about solving the challenges that come with pushing HPC to its limits.
Specializing in Asynchronous Many-Task Programming, I focus on building fault-tolerant and load-balanced systems that scale effortlessly as core counts keep growing.
With more cores come more failures: my mission is to ensure that supercomputers can thrive under pressure, delivering peak performance even when things go wrong.
From resilience to efficiency, I help keep the world's most powerful machines running at their best.

In the past, I have gathered experiences such as teaching at university, researching, working with regular clusters and supercomputers, and developing highly scalable software. If you are interested in what I have been up to, please have a look at my <a href="/projects/">Personal Projects</a>, my <a href="/publications/">Publications</a>, and my <a href="/cv/">CV</a>.
