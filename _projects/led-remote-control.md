**Overview:**
This personal project involved building a system for remotely controlling LED lights. It consisted of two main components: an Android client application written in Java, and a Windows server application written in C++. The client and server communicated over a TCP network connection, allowing the user to send commands from their Android device to the server, which would then interface with the LED hardware.

**Key Features:**
*   Android client for sending control commands.
*   Windows server for receiving commands and controlling LEDs.
*   TCP-based network communication.

**Technologies Used:**
*   Client: Android (Java)
*   Server: Windows (C++)
*   Communication Protocol: TCP/IP

**Role:** Solo Developer (Personal Project)
**Status:** Completed (2012), Not currently maintained.
