**Overview:**
I am currently developing a custom static portfolio website for a friend, Max. The site is built from scratch using fundamental web technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. The goal is to provide Max with a clean, professional online presence to showcase his skills and projects.

**Key Features:**
*   Clean and responsive design, adaptable to various screen sizes.
*   Optimized for fast loading as a static site.
*   Smooth scrolling and clean Vimeo video integration.

**My Role & Contributions:**
*   Full-stack development of the website.
*   Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.
*   Deployment and hosting setup on [max.miareitz.de](https://max.miareitz.de) (testing environment, not production!).

**Technologies Used:**
*   Core: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
*   Libraries: Locomotive Scroll, Klaro Consent Management

**Status:** Currently in development
