**Overview:**
This long-term personal project involved creating and managing custom role-playing (RP) gamemodes for both the SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer) and MTA (Multi Theft Auto) platforms. Development included extensive scripting in Pawn (for SAMP) and Lua (for MTA). Data persistence for player accounts and game state was handled using file-based CSVs in SAMP and SQLite databases in MTA. I also managed the small online communities that played these gamemodes.

**Key Activities:**
*   Gamemode design and feature scripting.
*   Database management for player data.
*   Server administration and community moderation.

**Technologies Used:**
*   Scripting Languages: Pawn (SAMP), Lua (MTA)
*   Databases: File-based CSV (SAMP), SQLite (MTA)
*   Platforms: SAMP, Multi Theft Auto

**Role:** Solo Developer & Community Manager (Personal Project)
**Status:** Completed (2011), Not currently live or maintained.
