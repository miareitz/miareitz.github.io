**Overview:**
This personal project (2015 - 2017), co-developed with my brother, involved creating an automated Bitcoin trading bot. The system was designed to simulate brokerage activities, train trading algorithms on historical data, and subsequently perform live trades. It interacted with the MtGox and later the Kraken exchange APIs via the XChange library, and utilized the Yahoo Finance API for additional data. Visualizations of trading data and performance were generated using JFreeChart.

**Key Features & Challenges:**
*   Acquisition and processing of large volumes of historical time series data for training, involving web scraping and data mining techniques.
*   Implementation of task-based parallel programming to handle the significant computational requirements for training models and running simulations.
*   Integration with live trading APIs for real-time decision making and order execution.
*   Development of data visualization components to analyze trading performance.

**Technologies Used:**
*   Languages/Libraries: Java, XChange, JFreeChart
*   APIs: MtGox API, Kraken API, Yahoo Finance API
*   Concepts: Algorithmic Trading, Data Mining, Parallel Processing

**Role:** Co-Developer (Personal Project with brother)
**Status:** Completed (2017), Not currently live or maintained.
