**Overview:**
As a self-employment initiative with my brother, we developed a web platform dedicated to advertising vacation rentals. The entire system, from backend logic to frontend presentation, was custom-coded without relying on existing CMS or frameworks. I primarily focused on the backend development, including database management with MySQL, while also contributing to frontend aspects. The platform was live and operational for approximately one year.

**Key Features:**
*   Custom-built platform for listing and searching vacation rentals.
*   User account management for property owners.
*   Dynamic content display and search functionality.

**Technologies Used:**
*   Backend: PHP, MySQL
*   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   Infrastructure: Self-hosted

**Role:** Co-Developer (Self-Employed with brother - Backend focus with frontend contributions)
**Status:** Operated for 1 year (Completed 2014), Deprecated.
